Configuration and scripts for the rspamd
========================================
Rspamd (Rapid spam daemon) is a fast, free and open source system for filtering spam.

Information about this system can be found on the Rspamd homepage:

I have been involved in information technology since 1995 and I am running my own mail system for study purposes since around 2002, based on Postfix. The configuration files and scripts in this repository are used productively by myself, so they have been tested to work. If they are not developed by myself, I provide the necessary references and if not stated otherwise, this information is published under the [GNU General Public License v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html.en)
